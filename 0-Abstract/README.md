The issue of driver's safety is of great importance in today's automotive industry. In many cases, a lack of proper vision is 
responsible for accidents during heavy rainfall. In many cases, manual errors like not increasing the speed of the wiper by the 
driver lead to accidents. Today's car wipers work on the principle of manual switching. In this paper, we proposed an automatic 
rain sensing wiper system that detects rain and starts automatically and stops when the rain stops. The automatic rain sensing 
car wiper system is not only automatic but also intelligent. The wiper system detects the rainfall automatically and starts itself. 
The Wiper system is also intelligent. When the droplets of rainfall on the sensor, the sensor detects the intensity and the speed 
of the wiper are automated accordingly. The higher speed of rotation indicates the higher rainfall. There will be no need for 
manual intervention for controlling wiper. In this project, we use Arduino along with a rain sensor, an LCD 16x2 module, and 
a servo motor. The moisture is measured via analog output pins which are present in the rain sensor, the wiper starts rotating 
when a threshold of moisture is exceeded. The module used here is completely based on LM393 op-amp. The information sensed 
by the rain sensor is sent to Arduino. The Arduino is an Atemga8 based microcontroller board. Interactive electronic devices 
can be designed and created by using Arduino, which is a platform to develop the working of electronic devices. It consists of an 
on-board power supply and a USB port to communicate with the pc. The collected information from the rain sensor is processed 
and analyzed by Arduino and it further controls the servo motor based on the processed information. The information about the
intensity of the rainfall and speed of the wiper is informed to the driver by means of a 4-bit LCD module which is kept near the 
driver's seat. The rain sensor is kept at the side of the windshield, outside the car. The rain sensor is connected to the servo 
motor. The blades of the wiper are connected to the servo motor. All the devices are connected to Arduino which is connected to 
the power source inside the car.
